During the first 28 days 90% of all coins will be distributed before the coin transitions to Slingshield and percentage based fees which will begin to form the backbone of the block rewards. Eventually the block rewards will completely be provided by percentage based fees beyond the initial distribution period.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n* X11 Proof of work.\r\n* 1 Million coins total.\r\n* 60 Second block time.\r\n* Digishield transitioning to Slingshield to provide sustainable difficulty adjustment tailored to the coins timeline.\r\n* 90% of coins are mined in the first 28 days of mining to combat inflation and price instability.\r\n* 0.5% transaction fees after 28 days, ensuring that mining remains profitable without hyperinflation.\r\n* 0.5% premine to aid development.\r\n* RPC port 33111, P2P port 33112\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n## Percentage fees\r\n\r\nOnce activated and the block rewards lowered the composition of block rewards will shift towards being more fee based and as such by the end of the block schedule the coin will be able to sustain itself with a high block reward solely comprised of coins from percentage fees. This ultimately ensures that the Fractalcoin network will remain secure for the significant future and that it'll also be economically viable.\r\n\r\n## Slingshield\r\n\r\nOnce activated Slingshield adjusts difficulty dynamically as transactions are added to a block. This significantly decreases the risk of attacks such as conducting a double spend as with Slingshield the attacker would now require 71% of network hashrate as opposed to 51%. This in turn ensures increased network security and a fair balance between both loyal miners and multipools that only mine blocks with high transaction fees.\r\n\r\nFull details on the Slingshield difficulty adjustment algorithm will be available in a white paper on our ANN thread.\r\n\r\n## Fair and stable launch\r\n\r\nInitially the block rewards for the first 30 blocks contain no coins, this is to ensure that the launch is as fair as possible. This means that pools have time to confirm that their systems are working as expected and that everyone has a fair chance to unlock their wallets and set up solo mining if they wish. \r\n\r\n## Transparent premine distribution\r\n\r\nThere will be a 0.5% or 5000 FRAC premine that will be used to fund further development of the coin and reward the founders and developers working hard to make this coin a reality, it will be distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n* 0.1% to each of the 3 founders.\r\n* 0.2% for bounties and development of the coin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Wallet\r\n\r\nThe Fractalcoin wallet is available in password protected form below. This password will be available in the ANN at launch.\r\n\r\n* Windows [primary](https://mega.co.nz/#!sNVUHbDD!zQT-XOyILdVh8aIwQWSC0CzVb7v3dTmtSM8YjAJk4f4) [mirror](http://earlz.net/static/fractalcoin_v1.0_win32.7z)\r\n* Mac OSX [primary](https://mega.co.nz/#!BJ9kWaZI!7nZWT2wgeF0RKN5wZRs9MjhxADj7hWHmX-fMPBWEH34) [mirror](http://earlz.net/static/fractalcoin_v1.0_mac.7z)\r\n* Linux coming soon\r\n\r\nThe github source code will be available at https://github.com/fractalcoin/fractalcoin\r\n\r\n# Pools\r\n\r\nPlease see the [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=650173.msg7279267#msg7279267) announcement for an up to date pool list\r\n\r\n# Reward Schedule\r\n\r\nAfter the initial 30 blocks to the reward schedule for this coin features a rapid distribution of coins for the first 28 days. There are large rewards for those mining on the first and last day of the initial phase to both reward early adopters and also to entice those who may have missed out originally at release.\r\n\r\n##Initial Fractal Phase: Digishield\r\n\r\n* 1: 5000 FRAC Premine\r\n* 2 - 32 : 0 FRAC (to ensure that launch is fair and everyone including pools are ready for launch.)\r\n* 33 -1472: 40 FRAC (1 day)\r\n* 1473-20192: 20 FRAC (13 days)\r\n* 20191-38912: 10 FRAC (13 days)\r\n* 38912-40352: 40 FRAC (1 day)\r\n\r\n## Final Fractal Phase: Slingshield and 0.5% fees activated \r\n\r\n* 40353-318230: 1 FRAC (approximately 221 days)\r\n* 318231 and onward: 0 FRAC\r\n\r\nFrom block 31830 onwards the block reward will be fully sustained by means of percentage fees.\r\n\r\n# Social media\r\n\r\nWe are present on most social media platforms and look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\n* [Offical website](http://fractalco.in)\r\n* [Twitter](http://twitter.com/fractalcoin)\r\n* [Facebook](http://facebook.com/fractalcoin)\r\n* [IRC (Freenode) - #fractalcoin](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#fractalcoin)\r\n* [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=650173.0)\r\n* [Cryptocointalk](https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/12308-pre-ann-frac-fractalcoin-x11-slingshield-fees-05-premine/)\r\n* [reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/fractalcoin)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

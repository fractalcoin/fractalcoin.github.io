<h1>
<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>Fractal Coin is a revolutionary X11 PoW coin featuring a new difficulty adjustment algorithm (Slingshield) and a unique two phase distribution plan which ensures that the coin remains sustainable and economically viable indefinitely. During the first 28 days 90% of all coins will be distributed before the coin transitions to Slingshield and percentage based fees which will begin to form the backbone of the block rewards. Eventually the block rewards will completely be provided by percentage based fees beyond the initial distribution period.</p>

<h2>
<a name="specification" class="anchor" href="#specification"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specification</h2>

<ul>
<li>X11 Proof of work.</li>
<li>1 Million coins total.</li>
<li>60 Second block time.</li>
<li>Digishield transitioning to Slingshield to provide sustainable difficulty adjustment tailored to the coins timeline.</li>
<li>90% of coins are mined in the first 28 days of mining to combat inflation and price instability.</li>
<li>0.5% transaction fees after 28 days, ensuring that mining remains profitable without hyperinflation.</li>
<li>0.5% premine to aid development.</li>
<li>RPC port 33111, P2P port 33112</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<h2>
<a name="percentage-fees" class="anchor" href="#percentage-fees"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Percentage fees</h2>

<p>Once activated and the block rewards lowered the composition of block rewards will shift towards being more fee based and as such by the end of the block schedule the coin will be able to sustain itself with a high block reward solely comprised of coins from percentage fees. This ultimately ensures that the Fractalcoin network will remain secure for the significant future and that it'll also be economically viable.</p>

<h2>
<a name="slingshield" class="anchor" href="#slingshield"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Slingshield</h2>

<p>Once activated Slingshield adjusts difficulty dynamically as transactions are added to a block. This significantly decreases the risk of attacks such as conducting a double spend as with Slingshield the attacker would now require 71% of network hashrate as opposed to 51%. This in turn ensures increased network security and a fair balance between both loyal miners and multipools that only mine blocks with high transaction fees.</p>

<p>Full details on the Slingshield difficulty adjustment algorithm will be available in a white paper on our ANN thread.</p>

<h2>
<a name="fair-and-stable-launch" class="anchor" href="#fair-and-stable-launch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fair and stable launch</h2>

<p>Initially the block rewards for the first 30 blocks contain no coins, this is to ensure that the launch is as fair as possible. This means that pools have time to confirm that their systems are working as expected and that everyone has a fair chance to unlock their wallets and set up solo mining if they wish. </p>

<h2>
<a name="transparent-premine-distribution" class="anchor" href="#transparent-premine-distribution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transparent premine distribution</h2>

<p>There will be a 0.5% or 5000 FRAC premine that will be used to fund further development of the coin and reward the founders and developers working hard to make this coin a reality, it will be distributed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>0.1% to each of the 3 founders.</li>
<li>0.2% for bounties and development of the coin.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="wallet" class="anchor" href="#wallet"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wallet</h1>

<p>The Fractalcoin wallet is available in password protected form below. This password will be available in the ANN at launch.</p>
